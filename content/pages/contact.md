You can contact me through email at flora [at] willitcode [dot] com. (Not a mailto link or typed out normally to hopefully dodge some of the spambots).

If you're emailing me, my PGP public key is available [on keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/87C7B8F013141211782258483777F7EED4E720D5). Download it from that link or via your favorite OpenPGP software and let's encrypt our emails!

I can also be contacted on Discord at @willitcode or on any of my other social medias.
